# Request-Logger
• A python script was created using the package module to send requests and the requests are
received and stored using request module.
• The script asks the user for the URL and requests (such as GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE).
• User also can edit the headers and parameters to supply information for PUT and POST functions.
• The responses from the URL are stored in a text file.
• When the parsing fails, the thrown exceptions are handled and the corresponding responses’s
headers, body and content are printed.
